The year Heraclius came to power, the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers. Heraclius immediately took charge of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628\" title=\"Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628\">Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628</a>.

Soon after, he initiated reforms to rebuild and strengthen the military. Heraclius drove the Persians out of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Minor\" title=\"Asia Minor\">Asia Minor</a> and pushed deep into their territory, defeating them decisively in 627 at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nineveh_(627)\" title=\"Battle of Nineveh (627)\">Battle of Nineveh</a>. The Persian king <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrau_II\" title=\"Khosrau II\"> Khosrow II</a> was overthrown and executed by his son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavad_II\" title=\"Kavad II\">Kavad II</a>, who soon sued for a peace treaty, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory. This way peaceful relations were restored to the two deeply strained empires.\r\n</p><p>Heraclius lost many of his newly-regained lands to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests\" title=\"Muslim conquests\">Muslim conquests</a>.
