<p><b>Leo VI Sophos</b>, called <b>the Wise</b> or <b>the Philosopher</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">Λέων ὁ Σοφός</span>, <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek" title="Romanization of Greek">romanized</a>: </small><i lang="el-Latn" title="Greek-language romanization">Leōn ho Sophos</i>, 19 September 866 – 11 May 912), was <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor" title="Byzantine Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> from 886 to 912. The second ruler of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_dynasty" title="Macedonian dynasty">Macedonian dynasty</a> (although his parentage is unclear), he was very well-read, leading to his epithet. During his reign, the renaissance of letters, begun by his predecessor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_I" title="Basil I">Basil I</a>, continued; but the Empire also saw several military defeats in the Balkans against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="First Bulgarian Empire">Bulgaria</a> and against the Arabs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean</a>. His reign also witnessed the formal discontinuation of several ancient Roman institutions, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul" title="Roman consul">Roman consul</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Senate</a> (in this period also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Senate" title="Byzantine Senate">Byzantine Senate</a>), which continued to exist in name only and lost much of their original functions and powers.
