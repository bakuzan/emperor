<p><b>Michael II</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">Μιχαήλ Β'</span>, <i>Mikhaēl II</i>), (770- 829), surnamed <b>the Amorian</b> (<span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ὁ ἐξ Ἀμορίου</span>) or <b>the Stammerer</b> (ὁ Τραυλός or ὁ Ψελλός), reigned as <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor" title="Byzantine Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> from 25 December 820 to his death on 2 October 829, the first ruler of the Phrygian or Amorian dynasty.

He helped Leo overthrow and take the place of Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I_Rangabe" title="Michael I Rangabe">Michael I Rangabe</a>. However, after they fell out Leo sentenced Michael to death. Michael then masterminded a conspiracy which resulted in Leo's assassination at Christmas in 820. Immediately he faced the long revolt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Slav" title="Thomas the Slav">Thomas the Slav</a>, which almost cost him his throne and was not completely quelled until spring 824.
