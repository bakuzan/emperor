He was the younger brother of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus\" title=\"Titus\">Titus</a> and the son of  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian\" title=\"Vespasian\">Vespasian</a>, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_dynasty\" title=\"Flavian dynasty\">Flavian dynasty</a>.  During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_senate\" title=\"Roman senate\">Senate</a>, whose powers he drastically curtailed. \r\n</p><p>Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"Praetorian Guard\">Praetorian Guard</a>.  His 15-year reign was the longest since that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius\" title=\"Tiberius\">Tiberius</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_currency\" title=\"Roman currency\">Roman coinage</a>, expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola\" title=\"Gnaeus Julius Agricola\">Agricola</a> attempted to conquer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia\" title=\"Caledonia\">Caledonia</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland\" title=\"Scotland\">Scotland</a>), and in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia\" title=\"Dacia\">Dacia</a>, where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decebalus\" title=\"Decebalus\">Decebalus</a>. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics; he saw himself as the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus\" title=\"Augustus\">Augustus</a>, an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_despotism\" title=\"Enlightened despotism\">enlightened despot</a> destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance. Religious, military, and cultural <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda\" title=\"Propaganda\">propaganda</a> fostered a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality\" title=\"Cult of personality\">cult of personality</a>, and by nominating himself perpetual <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_censor\" title=\"Roman censor\">censor</a>, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">Roman Senate</a>.\r\n</p><p>Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva\" title=\"Nerva\">Nerva</a>. After his death, Domitian's memory was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae\" title=\"Damnatio memoriae\">condemned to oblivion</a> by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus\" title=\"Tacitus\">Tacitus</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger\" title=\"Pliny the Younger\">Pliny the Younger</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius\" title=\"Suetonius\">Suetonius</a> propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Domitian/","name":"Domitian","dateOfBirth":"24 October 51","birthplace":"Rome, Roman Italy","dateOfDeath":"18 September 96","deathplace":"Rome, Roman Italy","house":"Flavian","succession":"Son of Vespasian","reignStart":"14 September 81","reignEnd":"18 September 96","reignLengthInDays":5479}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Domitian/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Titus/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Nerva/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2362595069","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
