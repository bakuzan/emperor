The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors\" title=\"Year of the Four Emperors\">Year of the Four Emperors</a>\" over the imperial succession.\r\n</p><p>Augustus was born <b>Gaius Octavius</b> into an old and wealthy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites\" title=\"Equites\">equestrian branch</a> of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs\" title=\"Plebs\">plebeian</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_(gens)\" title=\"Octavia (gens)\"><i>gens</i> Octavia</a>. His maternal great-uncle <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar\" title=\"Julius Caesar\">Julius Caesar</a> was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar\" title=\"Assassination of Julius Caesar\">assassinated</a> in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome\" title=\"Adoption in ancient Rome\">adopted</a> son and heir. Along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony\" title=\"Mark Antony\">Mark Antony</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir)\" title=\"Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)\">Marcus Lepidus</a>, he formed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate\" title=\"Second Triumvirate\">Second Triumvirate</a> to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Philippi\" title=\"Battle of Philippi\">Battle of Philippi</a>, the Triumvirate divided the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic\" title=\"Roman Republic\">Roman Republic</a> among themselves and ruled as <i>de facto</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator\" title=\"Roman dictator\">dictators</a>. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium\" title=\"Battle of Actium\">Battle of Actium</a> by Octavian in 31 BC.\r\n</p><p>After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">Roman Senate</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_magistrate\" title=\"Roman magistrate\">executive magistrates</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_assemblies\" title=\"Roman assemblies\">legislative assemblies</a>. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief\" title=\"Commander-in-chief\">supreme military command</a>, and those of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune\" title=\"Tribune\">tribune</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_censor\" title=\"Roman censor\">censor</a>. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps\" title=\"Princeps\">Princeps</a> Civitatis</i> (\"First Citizen\"). The resulting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Roman_Empire\" title=\"Constitution of the Roman Empire\">constitutional framework</a> became known as the Principate, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Roman_Empire\" title=\"History of the Roman Empire\">first phase of the Roman Empire</a>.\r\n</p><p>Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_(Roman_province)\" title=\"Egypt (Roman province)\">Egypt</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia_(Roman_province)\" title=\"Dalmatia (Roman province)\">Dalmatia</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonia\" title=\"Pannonia\">Pannonia</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum\" title=\"Noricum\">Noricum</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raetia\" title=\"Raetia\">Raetia</a>, expanding possessions in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_(Roman_province)\" title=\"Africa (Roman province)\">Africa</a>, and completing the conquest of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispania\" title=\"Hispania\">Hispania</a>, but suffered a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest\" title=\"Battle of the Teutoburg Forest\">major setback</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania\" title=\"Germania\">Germania</a>.
