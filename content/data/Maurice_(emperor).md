<p><b>Maurice</b> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a>: <i lang="la">Mauricius</i>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Μαυρίκιος</span>; 539 – 27 November 602) was <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor" title="Byzantine Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a> from 582 to 602. A prominent general, Maurice fought with success against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire" title="Sasanian Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>. After he became Emperor, he brought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_572%E2%80%93591" title="Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591">war with Sasanian Persia</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blarathon" title="Battle of Blarathon">victorious conclusion</a>. Under him the Empire's eastern border in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Caucasus" title="South Caucasus">South Caucasus</a> was vastly expanded and, for the first time in nearly two centuries, the Romans were no longer obliged to pay the Persians thousands of pounds of gold annually for peace.
</p><p>Maurice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice%27s_Balkan_campaigns" title="Maurice's Balkan campaigns">campaigned extensively</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Avars" title="Pannonian Avars">Avars</a> – pushing them back across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> by 599. He also conducted campaigns across the Danube, the first Roman Emperor to do so in over two centuries. In the west, he established two large semi-autonomous provinces called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarchate" title="Exarchate">exarchates</a>, ruled by <i>exarchs</i>, or viceroys of the emperor. In Italy Maurice established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarchate_of_Ravenna" title="Exarchate of Ravenna">Exarchate of Italy</a> in 584, the first real effort by the Empire to halt the advance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards" title="Lombards">Lombards</a>. With the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarchate_of_Africa" title="Exarchate of Africa">Exarchate of Africa</a> in 590 he further solidified the power of Constantinople in the western <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>.
</p><p>His reign was troubled by financial difficulties and almost constant warfare. In 602 a dissatisfied general named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocas" title="Phocas">Phocas</a> usurped the throne, having Maurice and his six sons executed. This event would prove a disaster for the Empire, sparking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628" title="Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628">twenty-six year war</a> with Sassanid Persia which would leave both empires devastated prior to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests" title="Muslim conquests">Muslim conquests</a>. His reign is a relatively well documented era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_antiquity" title="Late antiquity">late antiquity</a>, in particular by the historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylact_Simocatta" title="Theophylact Simocatta">Theophylact Simocatta</a>.
