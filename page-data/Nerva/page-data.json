Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisonian_conspiracy\" title=\"Pisonian conspiracy\">Pisonian conspiracy</a> of 65. Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul\" title=\"Roman consul\">consulships</a> in 71 and 90 during the reigns of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian\" title=\"Vespasian\">Vespasian</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian\" title=\"Domitian\">Domitian</a>, respectively.\r\n</p><p>On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"Praetorian Guard\">Praetorian Guard</a> and several of his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman\" title=\"Freedman\">freedmen</a>. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">Roman Senate</a>, although it is possible they were approving a decision made by the Praetorian Guard, as rare coins show him speaking with this group. As the new ruler of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Roman Empire</a>, he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian.\r\n</p><p>Nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army\" title=\"Roman army\">Roman army</a>. A revolt by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"Praetorian Guard\">Praetorian Guard</a> in October 97 essentially forced him to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome\" title=\"Adoption in ancient Rome\">adopt</a> an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan\" title=\"Trajan\">Trajan</a>, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes on 27 January 98.
