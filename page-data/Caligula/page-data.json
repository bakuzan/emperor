The son of the popular Roman general <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus\" title=\"Germanicus\">Germanicus</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus\" title=\"Augustus\">Augustus</a>'s granddaughter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Elder\" title=\"Agrippina the Elder\">Agrippina the Elder</a>, Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire\" title=\"Roman Empire\">Roman Empire</a>, conventionally known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty\" title=\"Julio-Claudian dynasty\">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>. Germanicus's uncle and adoptive father, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius\" title=\"Tiberius\">Tiberius</a>, succeeded Augustus as emperor of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome\" title=\"Ancient Rome\">Rome</a> in 14 AD.\r\n</p><p>Although he was born <b>Gaius Caesar</b>, after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar\" title=\"Julius Caesar\">Julius Caesar</a>, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\", the diminutive form of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligae\" title=\"Caligae\">caliga</a></i>) from his father's soldiers during their campaign in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania\" title=\"Germania\">Germania</a>. When Germanicus died at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch\" title=\"Antioch\">Antioch</a> in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri\" title=\"Capri\">Capri</a>, where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37 AD.\r\n</p><p>There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant\" title=\"Tyrant\">tyrant</a>. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principate\" title=\"Principate\">principate</a>. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_aqueduct\" title=\"Roman aqueduct\">aqueducts</a> in Rome: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Claudia\" title=\"Aqua Claudia\">Aqua Claudia</a> and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anio_Novus\" title=\"Anio Novus\">Anio Novus</a>. During his reign, the empire annexed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state\" title=\"Client state\">client kingdom</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania\" title=\"Mauretania\">Mauretania</a> as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Mauretania\" title=\"Roman Mauretania\">province</a>.\r\n</p><p>In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"Praetorian Guard\">Praetorian Guard</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">senators</a>, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic\" title=\"Roman Republic\">Roman Republic</a> was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius\" title=\"Claudius\">Claudius</a>, the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of his nephew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero\" title=\"Nero\">Nero</a> in 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares\" title=\"Julii Caesares\">Julii Caesares</a> in the male line.\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Caligula/","name":"Caligula","dateOfBirth":"31 August 12 AD","birthplace":"Antium, Italia","dateOfDeath":"24 January 41 AD","deathplace":"Palatine Hill, Rome","house":"Julio-Claudian","succession":"Great-nephew and adoptive grandson of Tiberius; natural son of Germanicus; great-grandson of Augustus.","reignStart":"16 March 37","reignEnd":"24 January 41 AD","reignLengthInDays":1407}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Caligula/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Tiberius/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Claudius/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2362595069","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
