His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan\" title=\"Trajan\">Trajan</a>. He married Trajan's grand-niece <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibia_Sabina\" title=\"Vibia Sabina\">Vibia Sabina</a> early in his career, before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan's wife <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeia_Plotina\" title=\"Pompeia Plotina\">Pompeia Plotina</a>. Plotina and Trajan's close friend and adviser <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Licinius_Sura\" title=\"Lucius Licinius Sura\">Lucius Licinius Sura</a> were well disposed towards Hadrian. When Trajan died, his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death.\r\n</p><p>Rome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after. They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession, and the senate held him responsible for it and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and territorial gains in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Mesopotamia\" title=\"Roman Mesopotamia\">Mesopotamia</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Assyria\" title=\"Roman Assyria\">Assyria</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Armenia\" title=\"Roman Armenia\">Armenia</a>, and parts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Dacia\" title=\"Roman Dacia\">Dacia</a>. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders and the unification of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall\" title=\"Hadrian's Wall\">Hadrian's Wall</a>, which marked the northern limit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain\" title=\"Roman Britain\">Britannia</a>.\r\n</p><p>Hadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests. He visited almost every province of the Empire, accompanied by an Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and he fostered, designed, or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome\" title=\"Pantheon, Rome\">Pantheon</a> and constructed the vast <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Venus_and_Roma\" title=\"Temple of Venus and Roma\">Temple of Venus and Roma</a>. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapeum_of_Alexandria\" title=\"Serapeum of Alexandria\">Serapeum of Alexandria</a>. He was an ardent admirer of Greece and sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the Empire, so he ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with Greek youth <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous\" title=\"Antinous\">Antinous</a> and the latter's untimely death led Hadrian to establish a widespread cult late in his reign. He suppressed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt\" title=\"Bar Kokhba revolt\">Bar Kokhba revolt</a> in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaea_Province\" title=\"Judaea Province\">Judaea</a>, but his reign was otherwise peaceful.\r\n</p><p>Hadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. He saw the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_bar_Kokhba\" title=\"Simon bar Kokhba\">Bar Kokhba revolt</a> as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. He executed two more senators for their alleged plots against him, and this provoked further resentment. His marriage to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibia_Sabina\" title=\"Vibia Sabina\">Vibia Sabina</a> had been unhappy and childless; he adopted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius\" title=\"Antoninus Pius\">Antoninus Pius</a> in 138 and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius\" title=\"Marcus Aurelius\">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus\" title=\"Lucius Verus\">Lucius Verus</a> as his own heirs. Hadrian died the same year at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiae\" title=\"Baiae\">Baiae</a>, and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon\" title=\"Edward Gibbon\">Edward Gibbon</a> includes him among the Empire's \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Good_Emperors\" title=\"Five Good Emperors\">Five Good Emperors</a>\", a \"benevolent dictator\"; Hadrian's own senate found him remote and authoritarian. He has been described as enigmatic and contradictory, with a capacity for both great personal generosity and extreme cruelty and driven by insatiable curiosity, self-conceit, and ambition.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[1]</a></sup> Modern interest was revived largely thanks to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Yourcenar\" title=\"Marguerite Yourcenar\">Marguerite Yourcenar</a>'s novel <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Hadrian\" title=\"Memoirs of Hadrian\">Mémoires d'Hadrien</a></i> (1951).\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Hadrian/","name":"Hadrian","dateOfBirth":"24 January 76","birthplace":"Italica, Hispania (most likely) or Rome, Italia","dateOfDeath":"10 July 138","deathplace":"Baiae, Italia","house":"Nerva-Antonine","succession":"Adopted son and heir of Trajan","reignStart":"10 August 117","reignEnd":"10 July 138","fields":{"reignLengthInDays":7634}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Hadrian/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Trajan/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Antoninus_Pius/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2362595069","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
