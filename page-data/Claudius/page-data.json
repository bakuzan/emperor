Born to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Claudius_Drusus\" title=\"Nero Claudius Drusus\">Drusus</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Minor\" title=\"Antonia Minor\">Antonia Minor</a> at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugdunum\" title=\"Lugdunum\">Lugdunum</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Gaul\" title=\"Roman Gaul\">Roman Gaul</a>, where his father was stationed as a military legate, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_(Roman_Empire)\" title=\"Italia (Roman Empire)\">Italy</a>. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine\" title=\"Sabine\">Sabine</a> origins<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[1]</a></sup>  and a member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty\" title=\"Julio-Claudian dynasty\">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul\" title=\"Roman consul\">consulship</a>, shared with his nephew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula\" title=\"Caligula\">Caligula</a> in 37.\r\n</p><p>Claudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius\" title=\"Tiberius\">Tiberius</a>' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared emperor by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard\" title=\"Praetorian Guard\">Praetorian Guard</a> after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire started its successful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain\" title=\"Roman conquest of Britain\">conquest of Britain</a>.\r\n</p><p>Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">senators</a>. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife.  After his death in 54 (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero\" title=\"Nero\">Nero</a> succeeded him as emperor.
