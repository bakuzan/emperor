He reigned jointly with his young son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadumenian\" title=\"Diadumenian\">Diadumenianus</a>. Macrinus was by origin a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers\" title=\"Berbers\">Berber</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania_Caesariensis\" title=\"Mauretania Caesariensis\">Mauretania Caesariensis</a>. A member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites\" title=\"Equites\">equestrian</a> class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate\" title=\"Roman Senate\">senatorial class</a> and was the first emperor from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania\" title=\"Mauretania\">Mauretania</a>. Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla\" title=\"Caracalla\">Caracalla</a> as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_prefect\" title=\"Praetorian prefect\">praetorian prefect</a> and dealt with Rome's civil affairs. He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor.\r\n</p><p>Macrinus was proclaimed emperor of Rome by 11 April 217 while in the eastern provinces of the empire and was subsequently confirmed as such by the Senate; however, for the duration of his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire\" title=\"Parthian Empire\">Parthia</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)\" title=\"Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)\">Armenia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia\" title=\"Dacia\">Dacia</a>. As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military.\r\n</p><p>Caracalla's aunt <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Maesa\" title=\"Julia Maesa\">Julia Maesa</a> took advantage of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus\" title=\"Elagabalus\">Elagabalus</a>, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Antioch_(218)\" title=\"Battle of Antioch (218)\">Battle of Antioch</a> on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions.
