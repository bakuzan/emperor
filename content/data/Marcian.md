Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticus_(Roman_Empire)" title="Domesticus (Roman Empire)">domesticus</a></i> (personal assistant) who served under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardabur_(consul_427)" title="Ardabur (consul 427)">Ardabur</a> and his son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspar" title="Aspar">Aspar</a> for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_II" title="Theodosius II">Theodosius II</a> on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulcheria" title="Pulcheria">Pulcheria</a>,  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Zeno" title="Flavius Zeno">Flavius Zeno</a>, a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, agreed to help Marcian to become emperor in exchange for the rank of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_(ancient_Rome)" title="Patrician (ancient Rome)">patrician</a>. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.
</p><p>Marcian reversed many of the actions of his predecessor, Theodosius II, in religious matters and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>'s relationship with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunnic_Empire" title="Hunnic Empire">Huns</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila" title="Attila">Attila</a>. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the Western Roman Empire, Marcian launched expeditions across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> into the Hungarian plain, defeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns" title="Huns">Huns</a> in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed Marcian to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.
</p><p>After Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation, settling numerous tribes within Eastern Roman lands as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foederati" title="Foederati">foederati</a></i> (subject tribes providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" title="Council of Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a>, which reversed the outcome of the earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Council_of_Ephesus" title="Second Council of Ephesus">Second Council of Ephesus</a> and declared that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> had two natures, divine and human. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidi" title="Solidi">solidi</a>. After his death, Aspar had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian" title="Leo I the Thracian">Leo I</a> elected as Eastern Roman Emperor.
