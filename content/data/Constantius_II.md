<p><b>Constantius II</b> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a>: <i lang="la">Flavius Julius Constantius Augustus</i>;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Κωνστάντιος</span>; 7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Emperor" title="Roman Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> from 337 to 361. His reign saw constant warfare on the borders against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire" title="Sasanian Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic peoples</a>, while internally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> went through repeated civil wars and usurpations. His religious policies inflamed domestic conflicts that would continue after his death.
</p><p>The second son of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I" title="Constantine I">Constantine I</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fausta" title="Fausta">Fausta</a>, Constantius was made <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(title)" title="Caesar (title)">Caesar</a></i> by his father in 324. He led the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Roman_army" title="Late Roman army">Roman army</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_wars_of_Constantius_II" title="Persian wars of Constantius II">war</a> against the Sasanian Empire in 336. A year later, Constantine I died, and Constantius became <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_(title)" title="Augustus (title)">Augustus</a></i> with his brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_(emperor)" title="Constantine II (emperor)">Constantine II</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constans" title="Constans">Constans</a>. He promptly oversaw the massacre of eight of his relatives, consolidating his hold on power. The brothers divided the empire among themselves, with Constantius receiving the eastern provinces. In 340, his brothers Constantine and Constans clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine dead and Constans as ruler of the west. The war against the Sasanians continued, with Constantius losing a major <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Singara" title="Siege of Singara">battle</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singara" title="Singara">Singara</a> in 344. Constans was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper" title="Usurper">usurper</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnentius" title="Magnentius">Magnentius</a>. 
</p><p>Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius waged a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_civil_war_of_350%E2%80%93353" title="Roman civil war of 350–353">civil war</a> against the usurper, defeating him at the battles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mursa_Major" title="Battle of Mursa Major">Mursa Major</a> in 351 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mons_Seleucus" title="Battle of Mons Seleucus">Mons Seleucus</a> in 353. Magnentius committed suicide after the latter battle, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire. In 351, Constantius elevated his cousin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_Gallus" title="Constantius Gallus">Constantius Gallus</a> to the subordinate rank of <i>Caesar</i> to rule in the east, but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother Julian, to the rank of <i>Caesar</i>.
</p><p>As emperor, Constantius promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism" title="Arianism">Arian Christianity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-paganism_policy_of_Constantius_II" title="Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II">persecuted</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism" title="Paganism">pagans</a> by banning sacrifices and closing pagan temples and issued laws discriminating against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a>. His military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamanni" title="Alamanni">Alamanni</a> in 354 and campaigned across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadi" title="Quadi">Quadi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians" title="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> in 357. The war against the Sasanians, which had been in a lull since 350, erupted with renewed intensity in 359 and Constantius traveled to the east in 360 to restore stability after the loss of several border fortresses to the Sasanians. However, Julian claimed the rank of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_(honorific)" title="Augustus (honorific)">Augustus</a> in 360, leading to war between the two after Constantius' attempts to convince Julian to back down failed. No battle was fought, as Constantius became ill and died of fever on 3 November 361 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopsuestia" title="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>, naming Julian as his rightful successor before his death.
