<p><b>Thomas Palaiologos</b> or <b>Palaeologus</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">Θωμᾶς Παλαιολόγος</span>, <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek" title="Romanization of Greek">romanized</a>: </small><i lang="el-Latn" title="Greek-language romanization">Thomas Palaiologos</i>; 1409 – 12 May 1465) was <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Morea" title="Despotate of Morea">Despot in Morea</a> from 1428 until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> conquest in 1460, though he continued to claim the title until his death in 1465. Thomas was the younger brother of the final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Byzantine_emperors" title="List of Byzantine emperors">Byzantine emperors</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_VIII_Palaiologos" title="John VIII Palaiologos">John VIII</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos" title="Constantine XI Palaiologos">Constantine XI</a> and also laid claim to the position of emperor following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople" title="Fall of Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople</a> in 1453, during which Constantine died.
</p><p>From 1453 to 1460, Thomas warred against his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrios_Palaiologos" title="Demetrios Palaiologos">Demetrios</a> over control of the Morea and over who was the rightful holder of the imperial title. This dispute came to an end when the Ottoman sultan <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, who had conquered Constantinople seven years prior, invaded the Morea. Thomas fled with his family to Italy and lived in exile in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> from 1461. In Rome, Pope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_II" title="Pope Pius II">Pius II</a> recognised him as the rightful "Emperor of Constantinople".
</p><p>Thomas died in 1465 and despite his attempts and hopes, he had failed to garner enough support to kick-start a crusade that could have helped him claim Constantinople and restore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. His claims to the position of emperor and Despot of the Morea were maintained after his death by his oldest son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Palaiologos" title="Andreas Palaiologos">Andreas</a>.
