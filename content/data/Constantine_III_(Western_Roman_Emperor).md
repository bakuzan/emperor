<p><b>Flavius Claudius Constantinus</b>,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Jones,_pg._316_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Jones,_pg._316-2">[2]</a></sup> known in English as <b>Constantine III</b> (died shortly before 18 September 411) was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> general who declared himself <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor" title="Western Roman Emperor">Western Roman Emperor</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Britannia</a> in 407 and established himself in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. He was co-emperor from 409 until 411.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Constantine rose to power during a bloody struggle in Roman Britain and was acclaimed emperor by the local legions in 407. He promptly moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>, taking all of the mobile troops from Britain, to confront the various Germanic invaders who had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine" title="Crossing of the Rhine">crossed the Rhine</a> the previous winter. Constantine gained the upper hand after several battles with the forces of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor" title="Western Roman Emperor">Western Roman Emperor</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)" title="Honorius (emperor)">Honorius</a>. As a result, Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor in 409. The activities of the invading tribes, raids by Saxons on the near-defenseless Britain and desertions by some of his top commanders led to a collapse of support. After further military setbacks he abdicated in 411. He was captured and executed shortly afterwards.
