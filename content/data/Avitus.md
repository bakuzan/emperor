<p><b>Marcus Maecilius Flavius Eparchius Avitus</b><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[i]</a></sup> c. 380/395<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[1]</a></sup> â€“ after 17 October 456 or in 457) was <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor" title="Western Roman Emperor">Western Roman Emperor</a> from 8 or 9 July 455 to 17 October 456. He was a senator and a high-ranking officer both in the civil and military administration, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Piacenza-Bobbio" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio">Bishop of Piacenza</a>.

For this reason, as Emperor he introduced several Gallic senators in the Imperial administration; this policy, however, was opposed by the Senatorial aristocracy and by the people of Rome, who had suffered from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(455)" title="Sack of Rome (455)">sack of the city</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals" title="Vandals">Vandals</a> in 455.

The possibility of a strong and useful alliance between the Visigoths and Romans faded, however, when Theodoric invaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispania" title="Hispania">Hispania</a> at Avitus' behest, which rendered him unable to help Avitus against the rebel Roman generals who deposed him.
