He and his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_VIII" title="Constantine VIII">Constantine</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[note 4]</a></sup> were named as co-rulers before their father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_II" title="Romanos II">Romanos II</a> died in 963. The throne went to two generals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Phokas" title="Nikephoros II Phokas">Nikephoros Phokas</a> (r. 963–969) then <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tzimiskes" title="John Tzimiskes">John Tzimiskes</a> (r. 969–976), before Basil became senior emperor. His influential great-uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Lekapenos" title="Basil Lekapenos">Basil Lekapenos</a> was the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> ruler of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> until 985.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[note 5]</a></sup> Basil II then held power for forty years.
</p><p>The early years of Basil's reign were dominated by civil wars against two powerful generals from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolian</a> aristocracy; first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardas_Skleros" title="Bardas Skleros">Bardas Skleros</a> and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardas_Phokas_the_Younger" title="Bardas Phokas the Younger">Bardas Phokas</a>, which ended shortly after Phokas' death and Skleros' submission in 989. Basil then oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire and the complete subjugation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="First Bulgarian Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_conquest_of_Bulgaria" title="Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria">its foremost European foe</a>, after a prolonged struggle. Although the Byzantine Empire had made a truce with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate" title="Fatimid Caliphate">Fatimid Caliphate</a> in 987–988, Basil led a campaign against the Caliphate that ended with another truce in 1000. He also conducted a campaign against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Khaganate" title="Khazar Khaganate">Khazar Khaganate</a> that gained the Byzantine Empire part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea" title="Crimea">Crimea</a> and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine-Georgian_wars" title="Byzantine-Georgian wars">series of successful campaigns</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Georgia" title="Kingdom of Georgia">Kingdom of Georgia</a>.
</p><p>Despite near-constant warfare, Basil distinguished himself as an administrator, reducing the power of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynatoi" title="Dynatoi">great land-owning families</a> who dominated the Empire's administration and military, filling its treasury, and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries. Although his successors were largely incapable rulers, the Empire flourished for decades after Basil's death. One of the most important decisions taken during his reign was to offer the hand of his sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Porphyrogenita" title="Anna Porphyrogenita">Anna Porphyrogenita</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_the_Great" title="Vladimir the Great">Vladimir I of Kiev</a> in exchange for military support, thus forming the Byzantine military unit known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard" title="Varangian Guard">Varangian Guard</a>. The marriage of Anna and Vladimir led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Kievan_Rus%27" title="Christianization of Kievan Rus'">Christianization</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan Rus'</a> and the incorporation of later successor nations of Kievan Rus' within the Byzantine cultural and religious tradition. Basil is seen as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Greece" title="Culture of Greece">Greek national hero</a> but as a despised figure among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarians" title="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>.
