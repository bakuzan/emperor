He was the son of a peasant and worked as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_changer" title="Money changer">money changer</a> until he was found a job at court by his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Orphanotrophos" title="John the Orphanotrophos">John the Orphanotrophos</a>. He caught the eye of the empress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Porphyrogenita" title="Zoë Porphyrogenita">Zoë Porphyrogenita</a> and they began a tempestuous and flagrant affair. Michael and Zoë conspired to murder her husband, Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_III_Argyros" title="Romanos III Argyros">Romanos III Argyros</a>, who was found dying in his bath in 1034. Michael and Zoë were married the same day and Michael was crowned emperor the day after.
</p><p>Michael, handsome and energetic, suffered from poor health and entrusted most of the business of government to his brother. He distrusted Zoë and went to lengths to ensure that he did not suffer the same fate as his predecessor. The fortunes of the Empire under Michael's reign were mixed, with his most triumphant moment coming in 1041 when he led the imperial army against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> rebels. He returned in triumph from this victory, but died a few months later.
