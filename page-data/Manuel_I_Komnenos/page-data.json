His reign saw the last flowering of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komnenian_restoration\" title=\"Komnenian restoration\">Komnenian restoration</a>, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and had enjoyed a cultural revival.\r\n</p><p>Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Adrian_IV\" title=\"Pope Adrian IV\">Pope</a> and the resurgent <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_West\" title=\"Latin West\">West</a>.

The passage of the potentially dangerous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Crusade\" title=\"Second Crusade\">Second Crusade</a> through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_I_Komnenos#Manuel_in_Antioch\" title=\"Manuel I Komnenos\">established a Byzantine protectorate</a> over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_states\" title=\"Crusader states\">Crusader states</a> of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outremer\" title=\"Outremer\">Outremer</a>. Facing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim\" title=\"Muslim\">Muslim</a> advances in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land\" title=\"Holy Land\">Holy Land</a>, he made common cause with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem\" title=\"Kingdom of Jerusalem\">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_invasions_of_Egypt\" title=\"Crusader invasions of Egypt\">participated in a combined invasion</a> of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid\" title=\"Fatimid\">Fatimid</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt\" title=\"Egypt\">Egypt</a>. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans\" title=\"Balkans\">Balkans</a> and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary\" title=\"Kingdom of Hungary\">Hungary</a> and Outremer under Byzantine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony\" title=\"Hegemony\">hegemony</a> and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east.\r\n</p><p>However, towards the end of his reign Manuel's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Myriokephalon\" title=\"Battle of Myriokephalon\">Myriokephalon</a>, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Sultanate_of_Rum\" title=\"Seljuk Sultanate of Rum\">Seljuk</a> position. Although the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hyelion_and_Leimocheir\" title=\"Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir\">Byzantines recovered</a> and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilij_Arslan_II\" title=\"Kilij Arslan II\">Kilij Arslan II</a>, Myriokephalon proved to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Myriokephalon#Aftermath\" title=\"Battle of Myriokephalon\">the final, unsuccessful effort</a> by the empire to recover the interior of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia\" title=\"Anatolia\">Anatolia</a> from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Turks\" title=\"Seljuk Turks\">Turks</a>.\r\n</p><p>Called <i>ho Megas</i> (<span lang=\"grc\" title=\"Ancient Greek language text\">ὁ Μέγας</span>, translated as \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great\" title=\"The Great\">the Great</a>\") by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\" title=\"Greeks\">Greeks</a>, Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kinnamos\" title=\"John Kinnamos\">John Kinnamos</a>, in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of \"the most blessed emperor of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople\" title=\"Constantinople\">Constantinople</a>\" in parts of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity\" title=\"Western Christianity\">Latin world</a> as well.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-M3_1-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-M3-1\">[1]</a></sup> Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komnenos\" title=\"Komnenos\">dynasty</a> he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-M3-4_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-M3-4-2\">[2]</a></sup>\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Manuel_I_Komnenos/","name":"Manuel I Komnenos","dateOfBirth":"28 November 1118","birthplace":"Unknown","dateOfDeath":"24 September 1180","deathplace":"Unknown","house":"Komnenoi","succession":"Son of John II","reignStart":"1143","reignEnd":"24 September 1180","fields":{"reignLengthInDays":13505}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Manuel_I_Komnenos/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/John_II_Komnenos/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Alexios_II_Komnenos/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2362595069","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
