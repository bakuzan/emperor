<p><b>Nikephoros III Botaneiates</b>, Latinized as <b>Nicephorus III Botaniates</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el">Νικηφόρος Βοτανειάτης</span>, 1002 – 10 December 1081), was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Byzantine_Emperors" title="List of Byzantine Emperors">emperor</a> from 7 January 1078 to 1 April 1081. He was born in 1002, and became a general during the reign of Byzantine Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_IX_Monomachos" title="Constantine IX Monomachos">Constantine IX Monomachos</a>, serving in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecheneg_revolt" title="Pecheneg revolt">Pecheneg revolt</a> of 1048–1053. His actions in guiding his forces away from the Pechenegs following the <a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Zygos_Pass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Battle of Zygos Pass (page does not exist)">Battle of Zygos Pass</a>, in which they suffered eleven days of harassment before finally reaching the Byzantine city of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrianople" title="Adrianople">Adrianople</a>, attracted the attention of fellow officers, and he received the title of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistros" title="Magistros">magistros</a></i> as a reward. Nikephoros served in the revolt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_I_Komnenos" title="Isaac I Komnenos">Isaac I Komnenos</a> against the Byzantine Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_VI_Bringas" title="Michael VI Bringas">Michael VI Bringas</a>, leading forces at the decisive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Petroe" title="Battle of Petroe">Battle of Petroe</a>. Under Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_X_Doukas" title="Constantine X Doukas">Constantine X Doukas</a> he was made <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dux" title="Dux">dux</a></i> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessalonica_(theme)" title="Thessalonica (theme)">Thessalonica</a>, where he remained until <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1065, when he was reassigned as <i>dux</i> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>. While <i>dux</i> of Antioch, he repelled numerous incursions from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Aleppo" title="Emirate of Aleppo">Emirate of Aleppo</a>. When Constantine X died in 1067, his wife, Empress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudokia_Makrembolitissa" title="Eudokia Makrembolitissa">Eudokia Makrembolitissa</a>, considered taking Nikephoros as husband and emperor, but instead chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_IV_Diogenes" title="Romanos IV Diogenes">Romanos IV Diogenes</a>. The need for an immediate successor was made pressing by the constant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire" title="Seljuk Empire">Seljuk</a> raids into Byzantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, and Eudokia, Patriarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_VIII_of_Constantinople" title="John VIII of Constantinople">John VIII of Constantinople</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Senate" title="Byzantine Senate">Byzantine Senate</a> agreed that their top priority was the defense of the empire and that they needed an emperor to lead troops to repel the Turks. Nikephoros was the favorite candidate of the senate, but was in the field leading troops in Antioch and was still married. Romanos, once chosen to be emperor, exiled Nikephoros to his holdings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolic_Theme" title="Anatolic Theme">Anatolic Theme</a>, where he remained until he was brought out of retirement by Emperor <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_VII" title="Michael VII">Michael VII</a> and made <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouropalates" title="Kouropalates">kouropalates</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategos" title="Strategos">strategos</a></i> of the Anatolic Theme.
</p><p>Nikephoros came into conflict with Michael in 1078 when he pleaded with the emperor to address the worsening situation in Byzantine Anatolia, insulting Michael with his frankness. In order to protect himself, Nikephoros gathered an army of native troops and Turkish mercenaries and declared himself emperor on 2 July 1078. Nikephoros gathered a strong support base due to his military acumen and family renown, allowing him to enter Constantinople on 24 March 1078 and seize the throne. As emperor, Nikephoros faced numerous revolts, including those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_Bryennios_the_Elder" title="Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder">Nikephoros Bryennios</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_Basilakes" title="Nikephoros Basilakes">Nikephoros Basilakes</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Doukas" title="Constantine Doukas">Constantine Doukas</a>, as well as an attempted assassination by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard" title="Varangian Guard">Varangian Guard</a>. Nikephoros embraced the trappings of emperor, performing many acts to increase his legitimacy and support, such as spending large amounts on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donativum" title="Donativum">donatives</a> for the army and his supporters, forgiving all debt <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_arrears" title="In arrears">in arrears</a>, and instituting minor legal reforms. Diplomatically, Nikephoros secured the submission of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Gabras" title="Theodore Gabras">Theodore Gabras</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philaretos_Brachamios" title="Philaretos Brachamios">Philaretos Brachamios</a>, governors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldia" title="Chaldia">Trebizond</a> and Antioch, respectively, who had become de facto independent of the Byzantine Empire due to the constant incursions of the Seljuks into Byzantine Anatolia.
</p><p>In 1081, the Norman Duke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Guiscard" title="Robert Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a> of Apulia prepared to invade the Byzantine Empire under the pretext of defending the succession of Constantine Doukas, who had been engaged to Robert's daughter Helena. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexios_I_Komnenos" title="Alexios I Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> was entrusted with an army and sent to defeat the Norman threat, but instead conspired with his relative John Doukas to seize the throne. Alexios raised a rebellion against Nikephoros and was able to quickly encircle Constantinople and besiege it, due to the lack of a defensive army. Nikephoros was unable to secure the support of either the Seljuk Turks or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_Melissenos" title="Nikephoros Melissenos">Nikephoros Melissenos</a>, his traditional rivals, and therefore was forced to prepare for abdication. Nikephoros decided that his only choice was to abdicate in favor of Melissenos, who was nearby in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damalis" title="Damalis">Damalis</a> in Anatolia, and sent messengers to him across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporus" title="Bosporus">Bosphorus</a>; however, these messengers were intercepted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Palaiologos" title="George Palaiologos">George Palaiologos</a>, a general of Alexios, who persuaded them to support Alexios. Alexios and his forces broke through the walls of Constantinople on 1 April 1081 and sacked the city. Nikephoros fled and sought sanctuary inside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. Nikephoros was taken from there to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._George_of_Samatya" title="Church of St. George of Samatya">Monastery of Peribleptus</a>, where he abdicated and became a monk. Nikephoros died later that year, on 10 December 1081.
