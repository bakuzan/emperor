<p><b>Honorius</b> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a>: <i lang="la">Flavius Honorius Augustus</i>; 9 September 384 â€“ 15 August 423) was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Emperor</a> from 395 to 423. He was the younger son of emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I" title="Theodosius I">Theodosius I</a> and his first wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aelia_Flaccilla" title="Aelia Flaccilla">Aelia Flaccilla</a>, and brother of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadius" title="Arcadius">Arcadius</a>, who was the Eastern Emperor from 395 until his death in 408. During his reign, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(410)" title="Sack of Rome (410)">Rome was sacked</a> for the first time in almost 800 years.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Even by the standards of the rapidly declining Western Empire, Honorius's reign was precarious and chaotic.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> His reign was supported by his principal general, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho" title="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>, who was successively Honorius's guardian (during his childhood) and his father-in-law (after the emperor became an adult). Stilicho's generalship helped preserve some level of stability, but with his execution in 408, the Western Roman Empire moved closer to collapse.
