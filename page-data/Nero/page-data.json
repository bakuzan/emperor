As time passed, he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. During his reign, the redoubtable general <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbulo\" title=\"Corbulo\">Corbulo</a> conducted a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Parthian_War_of_58%E2%80%9363\" title=\"Roman–Parthian War of 58–63\">successful war</a> and negotiated peace with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire\" title=\"Parthian Empire\">Parthian Empire</a>. His general <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius_Paulinus\" title=\"Suetonius Paulinus\">Suetonius Paulinus</a> crushed a major revolt in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain\" title=\"Roman Britain\">Britain</a>, led by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceni\" title=\"Iceni\">Iceni</a> Queen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudica\" title=\"Boudica\">Boudica</a>.

Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician and charioteer. In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. In contrast, his populist style of rule remained very popular among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. Various plots against his life were revealed; the ringleaders, most of them Nero's own courtiers, were executed.\r\n</p><p>In 68 AD <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindex\" title=\"Vindex\">Vindex</a>, governor of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul\" title=\"Gaul\">Gaulish</a> territory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Lugdunensis\" title=\"Gallia Lugdunensis\">Gallia Lugdunensis</a>, rebelled.

Vindex's revolt failed in its immediate aim, but Nero fled Rome when Rome's discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor.
