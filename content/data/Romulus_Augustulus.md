<p><b>Flavius Romulus Augustus</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circa" title="Circa">c.</a> AD 460 â€“ after AD 476; possibly still alive as late as AD 507),<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> known derisively and historiographically as <b>Romulus Augustulus</b>, was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor" title="Roman emperor">Roman emperor</a> who ruled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> from 31 October 475 until 4 September 476. He is often described as the "last Western Roman emperor", though some historians consider this to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos" title="Julius Nepos">Julius Nepos</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer%27s_deposition_of_Romulus_Augustulus" title="Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus">His deposition</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer" title="Odoacer">Odoacer</a> traditionally marks the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the West, <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="Decline of the Roman Empire">the end of Ancient Rome</a>, and the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> in Western Europe.
</p><p>Although he, as all other emperors, adopted the name <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_(honorific)" title="Augustus (honorific)">Augustus</a> upon his accession, he is better remembered by his derisive nickname <i>Augustulus</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> suffix <i>-ulus</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive" title="Diminutive">diminutive</a>; hence <i>Augustulus</i> effectively means "Little Augustus".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-romanemperors_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-romanemperors-5">[5]</a></sup> The name <i>Romulus</i> was also changed derisively to <i>Momyllus</i> meaning "little disgrace".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>The historical record contains few details of Romulus' life. He was the son of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes_(father_of_Romulus_Augustulus)" title="Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)">Orestes</a>, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila" title="Attila">Attila the Hun</a> before coming into the service of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos" title="Julius Nepos">Julius Nepos</a> in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum" title="Magister militum">magister militum</a></i>, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna" title="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> under his control, Orestes appointed his son Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">eastern court</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Romulus, however, was little more than a child and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurehead_(metaphor)" title="Figurehead (metaphor)">figurehead</a> for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer" title="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>, a Germanic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foederati" title="Foederati">foederatus</a> officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellum_Lucullanum" title="Castellum Lucullanum">Castellum Lucullanum</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania" title="Campania">Campania</a>, after which he disappears from the historical record.
