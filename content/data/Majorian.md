<p><b>Flavius Julius Valerius Majorianus</b> (c. AD 420 â€“ August 7, 461), usually known simply as <b>Majorian</b>, was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor" title="Western Roman Emperor">Western Roman Emperor</a> from 457 to 461.
</p><p>A prominent general of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Roman_army" title="Late Roman army">Late Roman army</a>, Majorian deposed Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitus" title="Avitus">Avitus</a> in 457 and succeeded him. Majorian was the last emperor to make a concerted effort to restore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> with its own forces. Possessing little more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Italy" title="Roman Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, and some territory in northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Gaul" title="Roman Gaul">Gaul</a>, Majorian campaigned rigorously for three years against the Empire's enemies.  His successors until the fall of the Empire, in 476/480, were actually instruments of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian" title="Barbarian">barbarian</a> generals, or emperors chosen and controlled by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Eastern Roman court</a>.
</p><p>After defeating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals" title="Vandals">Vandal</a> attack on Italy, Majorian launched a campaign against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Kingdom" title="Visigothic Kingdom">Visigothic Kingdom</a> in southern Gaul. Defeating king <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_II" title="Theodoric II">Theodoric II</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arelate" title="Battle of Arelate">Battle of Arelate</a>, Majorian forced the Goths to abandon their possessions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimania" title="Septimania">Septimania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispania" title="Hispania">Hispania</a> and return to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foederati" title="Foederati">federate</a> status immediately. Majorian then attacked the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_Kingdom" title="Burgundian Kingdom">Burgundian Kingdom</a>, defeating them at the <a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Lugdunum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Siege of Lugdunum (page does not exist)">Siege of Lugdunum</a>, expelling them from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhone" title="Rhone">Rhone</a> valley and reducing them to federate status.
</p><p>In 460, Majorian left Gaul to consolidate his hold on Hispania. His generals launched a campaign against the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suebic_Kingdom" title="Suebic Kingdom">Suebic Kingdom</a> in northwest Hispania, defeating them at the battles of <a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Lucus_Augusti&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Battle of Lucus Augusti (page does not exist)">Lucus Augusti</a> and <a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Scallabis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Battle of Scallabis (page does not exist)">Scallabis</a> and reducing them to federate status as well. His fleet for his planned campaign to recover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_(Roman_province)" title="Africa (Roman province)">Africa</a> from the Vandals was destroyed due to treachery.
</p><p>Majorian sought to reform the imperial administration in order to make it more efficient and just. The powerful general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricimer" title="Ricimer">Ricimer</a> deposed and killed Majorian, who had become unpopular with the senatorial aristocracy because of his reforms.
</p><p>According to historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, Majorian "presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-gibbon_extinction_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-gibbon_extinction-1">[1]</a></sup>
