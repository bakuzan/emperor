<p><b>Glycerius</b> (Latin: <i>Flavius Glycerius Augustus</i>) (Unknown – after 474 AD) was  <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor" title="Western Roman Emperor">Western Roman Emperor</a> from 473 to 474. He served as <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comes_domesticorum" title="Comes domesticorum">comes domesticorum</a></i> (commander of the palace guard) during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olybrius" title="Olybrius">Olybrius</a>, until Olybrius died on 2 November 472. After a four-month <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interregnum" title="Interregnum">interregnum</a>, Glycerius was proclaimed Western Emperor on 3 or 5 March 473 by the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum" title="Magister militum">magister militum</a></i> (master of soldiers) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_behind_the_throne" title="Power behind the throne">power behind the throne</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundobad" title="Gundobad">Gundobad</a>. Very few of the events of his reign are known other than that during his reign an attempted invasion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> by the Visigoths was repelled, diverting them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. Glycerius also prevented an invasion by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths" title="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> through gifts. Glycerius was not recognized by the Eastern Roman Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian" title="Leo I the Thracian">Leo I</a>, who instead nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos" title="Julius Nepos">Julius Nepos</a> as Emperor and sent him with an army to invade the Western Empire. Glycerius was without allies, because Gundobad had left to rule the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundians" title="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>, and therefore was forced to abdicate on 24 June 474. He was appointed <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Salona" title="Bishop of Salona">Bishop of Salona</a>, which position he held until his death.
