</p><p>Zoë's father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_VIII" title="Constantine VIII">Constantine VIII</a>, was nominal co-emperor to his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II" title="Basil II">Basil II</a> at the time of Zoë's birth. Basil died when Zoë was 47, leaving the Byzantine throne entirely to her father. As he had no sons, Constantine hoped to continue the dynasty by marrying off one of his daughters. Zoë, aged 50, was married to <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_Argyros" title="Romanos Argyros">Romanos Argyros</a>. They took the throne the next day on her father's death. 
</p><p>The marriage of Zoë and Romanos III was troubled and after five years Romanos was found dead in his bath. His death has been variously attributed to Zoë, her young lover, or both. They were married on the same day as the murder, and he was crowned <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Michael_IV" title="Emperor Michael IV">Emperor Michael IV</a> on the following day. Seven years later, Zoë was persuaded to adopt her dying husband's nephew, <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kalaphates" title="Michael Kalaphates">Michael Kalaphates</a>. 
</p><p>Once Michael V became emperor, he promptly exiled Zoë. This action sparked a popular revolt which dethroned him and installed Zoë and her sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_Porphyrogenita_(11th_century)" title="Theodora Porphyrogenita (11th century)">Theodora</a> as joint empresses. After a two-month joint reign Zoë married a former lover who was installed as <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_IX" title="Constantine IX">Constantine IX</a>, transferring power to him. Eight years later, Zoë died aged 72.
