His brilliant military exploits contributed to the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire during the 10th century. His reign, however, included controversy. In the west, he inflamed conflict with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire\" title=\"First Bulgarian Empire\">Bulgarians</a> and saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily\" title=\"Sicily\">Sicily</a> completely turn over to the Muslims, while he failed to make any serious gains in Italy following the incursions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\" title=\"Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor\">Otto I</a>. Meanwhile, in the east, he completed the conquest of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia\" title=\"Cilicia\">Cilicia</a> and even retook the island of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus\" title=\"Cyprus\">Cyprus</a>, thus opening the path for subsequent Byzantine incursions reaching as far as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Mesopotamia\" title=\"Upper Mesopotamia\">Jazira</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant\" title=\"Levant\">Levant</a>. His administrative policy was less successful, as in order to finance these wars he increased taxes both on the people and on the church, while maintaining unpopular theological positions and alienating many of his most powerful allies. These included his nephew <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tzimiskes\" title=\"John Tzimiskes\">John Tzimiskes</a>, who would take the throne after killing Nikephoros in his sleep.\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Nikephoros_II_Phokas/","name":"Nikephoros II Phokas","dateOfBirth":"c. 912","birthplace":"Cappadocia","dateOfDeath":"11 December 969","deathplace":"Constantinople","house":"Macedonian","succession":"Chosen by the army, acted as senior emperor during the regency of young emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII","reignStart":"16 August 963","reignEnd":"11 December 969","fields":{"reignLengthInDays":2307}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Nikephoros_II_Phokas/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Romanos_II/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/John_I_Tzimiskes/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2362595069","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
