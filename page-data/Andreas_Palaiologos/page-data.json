After the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople\" title=\"Fall of Constantinople\">Fall of Constantinople</a> in 1453 and the subsequent Ottoman invasion of the Morea in 1460, Thomas fled to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu\" title=\"Corfu\">Corfu</a>, with his children Andreas, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Palaiologos\" title=\"Manuel Palaiologos\">Manuel</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina\" title=\"Sophia Palaiologina\">Zoe</a>. After the death of Thomas in 1465, the then twelve-year-old Andreas moved to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome\" title=\"Rome\">Rome</a> and, as the nephew of the final <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_emperor\" title=\"Byzantine emperor\">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos\" title=\"Constantine XI Palaiologos\">Constantine XI</a>, became the head of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaiologos\" title=\"Palaiologos\">Palaiologos</a> family and the chief claimant to the throne of the ancient <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\" title=\"Byzantine Empire\">Byzantine Empire</a>.\r\n</p><p>Thus from the 1480s, Andreas claimed the title of \"Emperor of Constantinople\". His use of this title was supported by some of the Byzantine refugees who lived in Italy, but not officially by the Pope, who only recognised him as the Despot of the Morea.\r\n</p><p>In 1480, Andreas married a woman called Caterina, whom later historians have alleged was a prostitute, and he supposedly lived an extravagant and irresponsible lifestyle, which eventually led to him falling into poverty. A more likely cause for Andreas's poverty is probably the fact that the pension and funding provided to him by the Pope was constantly cut back, from an initial 300 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducat\" title=\"Ducat\">ducats</a> to just 50 ducats near the end of his life, far too little to sustain his household.\r\n</p><p>Though Andreas did travel Europe in search for a ruler who could aid him in retaking Constantinople, he rallied little support. The Ottoman Sultan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_the_Conqueror\" title=\"Mehmed the Conqueror\">Mehmed II</a>, who had conquered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople\" title=\"Constantinople\">Constantinople</a> in 1453, died in 1481 and his two sons <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Cem\" title=\"Sultan Cem\">Cem</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_II\" title=\"Bayezid II\">Bayezid</a> fought a civil war over who was to succeed him. Seeing his opportunity, Andreas attempted to organize an expedition in southern Italy during the summer of 1481 with the goal of crossing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea\" title=\"Adriatic Sea\">Adriatic Sea</a> and restoring the Byzantine Empire. The expedition was cancelled in the autumn when Bayezid had successfully stabilized his rule. Andreas would never return to Greece.\r\n</p><p>Desperate for money, Andreas sold his rights to the Byzantine crown in 1494 to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France\" title=\"Charles VIII of France\">Charles VIII of France</a> and later granted the same rights in his will to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon\" title=\"Ferdinand II of Aragon\">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile\" title=\"Isabella I of Castile\">Isabella I of Castile</a>. Andreas kept for himself only the title of Despot of the Morea, though he probably never received the money due for the sales of the imperial title. He died in poverty in Rome in 1502.\r\n</p>"},"emperorsJson":{"slug":"/Andreas_Palaiologos/","name":"Andreas Palaiologos","dateOfBirth":"17 January 1453","birthplace":"Morea","dateOfDeath":"7 April 1502","deathplace":"Rome","house":"Palaiologos","succession":"Son of Thomas.
